## WHAT GHL REPLACES

- **Calendly** ($10) → GHL has built-in scheduling
- **Mailchimp** ($60) → GHL has email marketing
- **HoneyBook** ($79) → GHL has invoicing + contracts
- **Zapier** ($69) → GHL has workflow automations
- **Website builder** ($25) → GHL has funnels + sites
- **Social scheduling** → GHL has basic social posting
- **SMS marketing** → GHL includes it
- **Reputation management** → GHL includes review requests

**Savings from GHL consolidation: ~$243/mo in tools it replaces**

## LOCAL AI IMPACT ON THIS STACK

With the local two-box setup ($24,266 one-time), here's what goes away or gets dramatically cheaper:

| Cloud Tool | Monthly | Local Replacement |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Claude Max | $200 | Kimi K2 / GPT-OSS-120B on Mac Ultra |
| Veo 3 Ultra | $250 | Wan 2.2 on RTX PRO 6000 |
| Nano Banana Pro | $24 | Own GPU |
| ElevenLabs Pro | $99 | Qwen3-TTS local |
| Runway Unlimited | $76 | Wan 2.2 + ComfyUI |
| Midjourney Pro | $60 | Flux 2 Dev + Z-Image local |
| Descript | $50 | Whisper local + LLM editing |
| **Total Eliminated** | **$759/mo** | |

**$759/mo x 12 = $9,108/yr saved on generative AI alone**

Hardware pays for itself in under 3 years, and that's conservative since you'd be paying for 2 users (Kyle + dad).

### Tools That Stay Cloud (Can't Replace Locally)
- Adobe CC ($80) — no local alternative at that quality
- GoHighLevel ($297) — SaaS CRM, needs to be cloud for client access
- Semrush ($199) — SEO data requires their crawlers
- Hootsuite ($99) — social API access
- Canva ($10) — convenience
- Notion ($10) — team collaboration
- QuickBooks ($30) — accounting/tax compliance

**Remaining cloud: ~$725/mo = $8,700/yr**

### Total Cost Comparison (3-Year)
- **All Cloud**: $16,020/yr x 3 = **$48,060**
- **Hybrid (Local AI + Cloud SaaS)**: $24,266 hardware + ($8,700 x 3) = **$50,366**
- **Hybrid 2-User**: Same hardware serves both Kyle + Dad. Cloud for 2 users would be ~$25,000/yr = $75,000 over 3 years. Hybrid = $24,266 + $26,100 = **$50,366**

The more users you add, the more local AI wins. For 2 users the savings are **$24,634 over 3 years**.
